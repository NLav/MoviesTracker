🚧 Work in Progress

**MoviesTracker** is a personal portfolio project for tracking movies and TV shows across different watch states such as watched, want to watch, or stopped. Titles can be rated using a 5-star rating system.

The application is built with [**React**](https://react.dev/), [**Vite**](https://vite.dev/), and [**TailwindCSS**](https://tailwindcss.com/), with state management handled via [**Redux**](https://redux.js.org/). It consumes a local API developed as a separate project, maintaining a clear separation between frontend and backend responsibilities.

The codebase follows clean code principles and is structured with a strong focus on scalability and maintainability, supported by [**ESLint**](https://eslint.org/), [**Prettier**](https://prettier.io/), and consistent project conventions to enforce code quality and architectural patterns.
